        Character Recognition in images is a vital task as it provides conversion of characters in
        the real world to the characters the virtual world. The basic version of this problem is the
        Optical Character Recognition (OCR), which works well for a scanned image with xed size
        characters in a specied boundary. The advanced version of this problem in recognizing
        multiple characters in unconstrained natural images. We try to solve the problem of detect-
        ing unknown number of digits, with varying shape and orientation, in natural images. For
        this task we have used the publicly available Street View Housing Number (SVHN) data
        set. We have built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model called '11Class' for this
        classication task. The entire problem has 3 major parts namely Localization, Segmentation
        and Classication. 11Class model integrates segmentation and classication via use of CNN
        that works directly on the cropped multi-digit housing numbers. This model consists of 3
        convolutional layers and 2 fully connected layers. We have developed a base model based
        on a CNN with 2 layers. Base model is used to compare accuracy results.
